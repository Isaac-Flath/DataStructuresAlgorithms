Task0:  The complexity is O(4) as there are 2 assignment statements and 2 print statements.  This is simplified to show just the order as O(1)

Task1: O(n).  This is a linear solution because we go through each input only once (in the destructured assignment statments).

Task2: O(n^2).  The worste case is caused by the two loops (aggregation loop, and finding max loop).  If the unique telephone numbers are equal to the count of telephone numbers this worste case will occur. 

Task3:  O(nlogn).  The complexity comes from the sort algorithm.  

task4:  O(nlogn).  The complexity comes from the sort algorithm.
